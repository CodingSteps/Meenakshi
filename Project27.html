	<!-- Prompt the user for an operator with the text "Enter an operator: " The only valid inputs are + , -, *, or /. 
	If the user enters anything other than these 4 characters, keep re-prompting.

	Next prompt for the first operand with the text "Enter the first operand: ", followed by another prompt for the second operand with the text "Enter the second operand: " (Note: An operand is just the term for the number that appears on the left or right of the operator).

	If either operand is NaN (not a number), use an alert box to display the text “Error - at least one operand is NaN”

	Hint: There is a function called isNaN that can help you with this. For details, do a little research and look it up. 

	For example, if the input is *, 7, hi (entered one at a time for the 3 prompts), the alert box will say: 

		Error - at least one operand is NaN

	Otherwise, assuming both operands can be converted to numbers, do the calculation and display the result in an alert box.  For example, if the input is -, 12, 20 (entered one at a time for the 3 prompts), the alert box will say: 

		12 -20 = -8

	As another example, if the user re-loads the page and now enters *, 5, -2 (entered one at a time for the 3 prompts), the alert box will say: 

		5 * -2 = -10

	But remember that you cannot divide by zero, so if a user enters input such that operand two is 0, you should not divide. For example, for the input:  /, 5, 0 (entered one at a time for the 3 prompts), the alert box will say: 

		Cannot divide by zero. -->
