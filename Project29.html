	<!-- In this program, you will develop a guessing game.  A number will be randomly generated from 1 to 10.  You can use the code:  

		/let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);  //assigns to num a number from 1 to 10

	The user will try to guess the number.  When the user finally gets the number, you have to tell them how many guesses it took.

	For example, let us assume the randomly generated number is 8 (remember it can be any number from 1 to 10 and the value will change every time you re-load the page). The user will always first see a prompt with the text: “I am thinking of a number from 1 to 10, guess the number.”

	Let us assume, that the user enters 9.  Since this is the wrong answer, the user will see a prompt with the text “Wrong, guess again:” Let us assume, that the user now enters 2.  Since this is also the wrong answer, the user will again see a prompt with the text “Wrong, guess again:” Let us now assume, that the user enters 8.  Since this is the correct answer, the user will see the alert box with the text

		You got it with 3 guess(es).  The number was: 8

	Of course, if the user had not said 8 on the third try, the “Wrong, guess again:” prompt would have come up instead of the alert box.  Assuming the user got it after 5 guesses, then the alert box would have said: 

		You got it with 5 guess(es).  The number was: 8

	The user can re-load the page and play the game again. -->

	<script type="text/javascript">

		let number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
		let guessCount = 1;	
		let guess = Number(prompt("I am thinking of a number from 1 to 10, guess the number!"));

		while(guess !== number)
		{
			guess = Number(prompt("Wrong, guess again!"));

			guessCount++;
		}

		if(guess === number)
		{
			alert(`You got it with ${guessCount} guess(es)! The number was: ${number}.`);
		}
