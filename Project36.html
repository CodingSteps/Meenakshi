	<!-- In the main function, you will prompt for a start value and an end value. Use a loop to
	validate that start <= end, and that start and end are not NaN. Re-prompt if you get invalid
	values. Next prompt for a character. You can assume that you will get a 1 character string.

	Your main function will call another function with the following prototype:
		
		function makeTriangle(start, end, myChar)

	This function will not return anything but will display to the webpage a triangle with end rows.
	A triangle just means that the first row has one character, the second row has 2 charactersâ€¦
	the nth row has n characters. You will use * for all rows before start. Starting with row
	start, you will alternate between printing the row number or the character input by the user.
	For example, if the call to makeTriangle is:
		
		makeTriangle(4, 8, "?");
	
	The output will be:
	
	*
	* *
	* * *
	4 4 4 4
	? ? ? ? ?
	6 6 6 6 6 6
	? ? ? ? ? ? ?
	8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 -->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		
		let startVal = Number(prompt("Please enter the start value."));
		let endVal = Number(prompt("Please enter the end value."));
		let symbol = prompt("Please enter a symbol.");

		let i;
		let j;
		let star = "*";

		function makeTriangle(start,character,end)
		{
			let p = 1;

			for (i = 1; i <= end; i++)
			{
				for(j = i; j >= 1; j--) // 'for(j = 1; j <= i; j++)' will also work as a condition for the inner for-loop.
				{
					if(i<start)
					{
						document.writeln(star);
					}
					else
					{
						if(p%2 !== 0)
						{
							document.writeln(i);
						}
						else
						{
								document.writeln(character);
						}
					}

					// put p++ here if you want to alternate characters (after the '*' triangle) instead.
				}

				p++;

				document.writeln('<br>');	
			}
		}
		
		makeTriangle(startVal,symbol,endVal);
