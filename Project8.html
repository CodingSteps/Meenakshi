<p>
	<strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong> is a fictional private detective created by British author <strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</strong>. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with <mark>observation, deduction, forensic science, and logical reasoning</mark> that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including <strong>Scotland Yard</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    First appearing in print in <em>1887's A Study in Scarlet</em>, the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The <em>Strand Magazine</em>, beginning with "<i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i>" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling <mark>four novels and 56 short stories</mark>. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of <mark>Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson</mark>, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of <i>221B Baker Street, London,</i> where many of the stories begin.
</p>
<p>
    Though not the first fictional detective, <b>Sherlock Holmes</b> is arguably the best known. By the 1990s there were already <mark>over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications featuring the detective, and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history</mark>. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretense. The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for <mark>over one hundred years</mark>.
